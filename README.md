# TMTrackRandomizer
TMTrackRandomizer is, as its name suggests, a track randomizer for the game TrackMania Nations Forever.

## Usage
### Easy (recommended)
Go to https://tmtrackrandomizer.linuxcat.repl.co/ and enter the corresponding settings.

### Advanced
You need to install [this pygbx fork](https://github.com/L-i-n-u-x-C-a-t/pygbx).\
Download this repository and execute `python3 randomizer.py`.\
There should be a default Template.Challenge.Gbx, but you're free to save a new one and replace the default with yours.\
That can help if you want to edit the challenge with ChallengeEdit without having to open the game and re-save the map.



## Thanks to
