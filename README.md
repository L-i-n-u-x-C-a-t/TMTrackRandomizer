# TMTrackRandomizer
TMTrackRandomizer is, as its name suggests, a track randomizer for the game TrackMania Nations Forever.

## Usage
Right now, there's no executable, so you need Python 3.7+ to launch this.\
You also need to install [pygbx](https://github.com/donadigo/pygbx).\
Download this repository and execute `python3 randomizer.py`.\
There should be a default Template.Challenge.Gbx, but you're free to save a new one and replace the default with yours.\
That can help if you want to edit the challenge with ChallengeEdit without having to open the game and re-save the map.\

## Thanks to
Big thanks to donadigo who made the pygbx library as well as the block utils and the savegbx.py.\
Also thanks to all the contributors of pygbx.
